            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Adam Sprackling</hi> E≈øquire, of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Pari≈øh in that I≈øle, about 20. year ≈øince, married <hi>Katherine,</hi> the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118431:3"/>
Daughter of Sir <hi>Robert Leukner,</hi> of <hi>Kent;</hi> This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having a fair e≈øtate in Lands, and being above thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands of his Nelghbours in E≈øtate, wanting the grace of Humility, exalted him≈øelf above mea≈øure, affected pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence in all Companies, u≈øed, in his braveries, long hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ride about the I≈øland, and frequent Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou≈øes, and there to Rant and roar, game and ≈øwear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, upon the lea≈øt provocation, and u≈øed to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and draw his weapon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He regarded not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but prophan'd it at home; The publick wor≈øhip of God, and Preaching of the Word, he ≈øeldome or never attended; delighted much in the company of drunken Mini≈øters. This man, having much wa≈øted his e≈øtate by his riotous cour≈øes, was of late pur≈øued with arre≈øts and ≈øutes at Law for debts, which he had contracted; and divers that entred into bond for him left to ruine, and impri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling</hi> had Executions out again≈øt him, and Bailiffs ready to apprehend him, whereby he was con≈øtreined to make his own hou≈øe his pri≈øon, to keep home, and could not dominier abroad, and ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as heretofore. Upon this occa≈øion he grew ≈øad, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, and petulent, and full of rage in his hou≈øe; His Wife being divers times con≈øtreined to lock up her ≈øelf from him. She was a woman of precious report for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertues, and (with <hi>Mary</hi>) did choo≈øe the better part: But upon Saturday at night <hi>December</hi> 11. la≈øt, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter <hi>Sprackling</hi> being re≈øolved to mi≈øchief her, as the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel manife≈øted, He then being in the Kitchin of his hou≈øe, had one <hi>Lamming</hi> a neighbour of his with him, and he then ≈øent for one <hi>Knowler</hi> a Sea-man to come to him; but it being ten of the clock at night, he de≈øired to be excu≈øed, ≈øaying he was in bed; whereupon Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling</hi> ≈øent for one <hi>Martin,</hi> a poor old man, a Tenant, and neighbour of his, who (though in bed) did ari≈øe and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118431:3"/>
come to Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling,</hi> and then <hi>Lamming</hi> de≈øired that he might go home, which reque≈øt Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling</hi> granted. So there remained Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling</hi> and his Wife, and <hi>Martin,</hi> and one <hi>Ewell,</hi> ≈øervant to Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling,</hi> the≈øe four only in the Kitchin; His Daughter and Maid-≈øervant got away (≈øeeing his rage) and locked them≈øelves all night in an out-room far from the Kitchin. Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> would not go to bed, though it grew late, but commanded <hi>Martin</hi> to bind <hi>Ewells</hi> legs, which he did accordingly with a dogs couplings, and ≈øo <hi>Ewell</hi> ≈øat bound all night after on the ground. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Ewell</hi> conceived it only a frolick or ranting fit or humour come on him, ≈øuch as they had been formerly acquainted with.</p>
            <p>Then he began to rage again≈øt his Wife, who ≈øate quietly there: her words to him were full of loving and ≈øweet expre≈ø≈øions; but he on a ≈øudden drew his Dagger, and ≈øtruck her with it on the face, which blow hurt her jaw; but ≈øhe was very patient, and ≈øayd little to him; but he ≈øtill raged again≈øt her; And towards morning the good Gentlewoman being weary, and in great fear, ro≈øe up to go out of the room, and lifting up her hand to open the dore, her Husband following her with a chopping-knife in his hand, cut her wri≈øt therewith, ≈øo, that the bone was cut in ≈øunder; her hand hung down only by the ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes and skin; No help was neer, <hi>Ewell</hi> bound, and <hi>Martin</hi> old and weak, and fearing his own life, dur≈øt not interpo≈øe, but only prayed his Mi≈øtris to ≈øtay and be quiet, he ≈øayd he hoped all would be well; And <hi>Martin</hi> got a napkin and bound up her hand with it. After this, towards morning, Mr. <hi>Sprackling,</hi> raging and rayling at her, da≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her on the forehead with the Iron Cleaver or Chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-knife. Then ≈øhe fell down bleeding, but recovered her ≈øelf on her knees, and kneeling cryed, and prayed to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118431:4"/>
God for pardon of her own ≈øins, and of her Husbands ≈øin, be≈øeeching God to forgive him, for ≈øhe forgave him. But, in the time of her praying thus, her Husband chopt her head in the mid≈øt into the brains, ≈øo that ≈øhe fell down ≈øtark dead in≈øtantly, lying in her own blood; Then he killed ≈øix dogs, four of which he threw be≈øides his wife, and after ≈øhe was dead, he cut her in the leg in two places, and compelled <hi>Martin</hi> to wa≈øh <hi>Ewells</hi> face with her blood, he al≈øo dipped linnen in her blood, and be≈ømeared <hi>Martin's</hi> face with her blood, and bebloudied his own face with it.</p>
            <p>For this Fact Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling</hi> was apprehended that night, having his Dagger in one hand, and Pi≈øtoll in the other hand; but he was ≈øurprized, and taken by one <hi>Martin Brook.</hi> The next day he was carried to <hi>Sandwich</hi> Jayl: And after the Maior of <hi>Sandwich</hi> (being Coroner) and his Inque≈øt had ≈øate upon the death of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, <hi>Martin</hi> al≈øo was ≈øent to Pri≈øon. The Se≈ø≈øions at <hi>Sandwich</hi> followed on Friday the 22. of <hi>April</hi> la≈øt. The Steward of the Court Mr. <hi>Peter Peak</hi> a Coun≈øellour of <hi>Grayes</hi>-Inne, gave a godly and learned charge to the Grand Inque≈øt, and, after mention of many ≈øins, he ≈øpake of the crying ≈øin of Murther, what a land-defiling and God-provoking ≈øin it was, as he evidenced by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; As, of the Sword not departing from the hou≈øe of <hi>David,</hi> for his murther of <hi>Uriah,</hi> by the Sword of the Ammonites; For the blood of <hi>Naboth,</hi> the dogs lickd the bloud of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and three≈øcore and ten ≈øons of his had their bloud ≈øhed afterward, and dogs did eat bloudy <hi>Jezabel;</hi> The ≈øons of bloudy <hi>Saul</hi> hang'd up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, for the direction of the Court, he came to ≈øome ca≈øes of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øhewing in ≈øuch ca≈øes there was malice expre≈øt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice implyed, malice ≈øupplyed. Malice expre≈øt, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thereupon, is ordinary: but if a man intend malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118431:4"/>
to kill one, and it fall out, that he kill not the party, which he de≈øired to mi≈øchief, but another, it is murther. He ≈øhewed out of his Law-books, that a Father-in-law procured phy≈øick for his ≈øick Son-in-law; The Phy≈øician pre≈øcribed a comfortable Medicine, which the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary made accordingly of ≈øeverall Ingredients; The Son-in law took ≈øome of it, but it had almo≈øt killed him, though cordiall Phy≈øick; The Father-in-law went to the Doctor of Phy≈øick, and told him how the Cordiall wrought; Hereupon the Apothecary was ≈øent for, and examined touching the Ingredients; He replied, he had put nothing in, but as the Phy≈øician directed, and that he knew the phy≈øick ≈øo Cordiall, that he would take it him≈øelf, and, to ju≈øtifie him≈øelf, did take part of that Medicine; but, he ≈øoon dyed: Afterwards it was found out, that the wife of the ≈øick man had put poy≈øon in the Medicine, thinking thereby to poy≈øon her Husband; but, he being of a ≈øtronger nature than the Apothecary, did e≈øcape, though hardly: but the woman was executed for the Apothecaries death, though ≈øhe intended not his death, becau≈øe there was malice expre≈øt, murther intended.</p>
            <p>Malice implyed was where no expre≈ø≈øion of malice in words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appeared in the ≈ølayer; as if a Son put his aged Father out of dores in a fro≈øty night, and he dy, its murther; <hi>Non refert an occidat, an cau≈øam mortis praebeat.</hi> If two be together, and, no provocation given or known, one kill the other, there is malice implied; it's Murther.</p>
            <p>Malice ≈øupplied, this he ≈øhewed in two Children in King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øeventh's time, one nine year old, the other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; one kill'd the other, and, becau≈øe the ≈ølayer denyed the fact, and cunningly by excu≈øes ≈øought to hide it, and to acquit him≈øelf of it, it was found Murther; Malice was ≈øupplyed in Law, to be in the Child though not of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent age, and the Child was thereupon executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118431:5"/>After the Grand Inque≈øt had received the Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, which was pre≈øented in Court by Mr. <hi>Steward Leukner,</hi> brother of Mr. <hi>Spracklings</hi> wife, the Inque≈øt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, returned to the Bar, finding both Mr. <hi>Sprack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> guilty of the Murther of Mi≈øtris <hi>Sprackling.</hi> After dinner the Jury of life and death was called, Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> pleaded not guilty; and referred them≈øelves to a fair tryall: Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> held up his trembling hand at the Bar; but when the Jury came one by one to be ≈øworn, he excepred again≈øt, and put by 20. of them, ≈øhewing no rea≈øon for it; but, he not being permitted by Law to except again≈øt any more, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øhewing rea≈øon for it, a Jury was at la≈øt filled up and ≈øworn. And the murther as before rehear≈øed, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Ewell;</hi> (for <hi>Martin</hi> being a Pri≈øoner and party, could give no evidence.)</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> pleaded for him≈øelf, that he was mad when he kill'd his Wife; and that he knew not what he did: but <hi>Lamming,</hi> being depo≈øed, te≈øtified, that when he left Mr. <hi>Sprackling,</hi> that Saturday night, he perceived no di≈øtemper in him, but that he was as he u≈øed to be at other times: And <hi>Jo≈øeph Cowell</hi> his Tenant, who ≈øaw him that Sabbath after the Murther done, te≈øtified that he was as he u≈øed to be, only he ≈øpake thick, and often of bloud, blood, blood. And it was te≈øtified by <hi>Roger Streven,</hi> who ≈øaw him next morning after the fact, when he went to Pri≈øon; He depo≈øed that he ≈øaw no ≈øign of di≈øtraction in him, but was rationall in his di≈øcour≈øe, and provided a Wagon with a bed in it for his conveyance to <hi>Sandwich</hi> Pri≈øon; And <hi>Roger Streven</hi> depo≈øed, that he heard it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> ≈øaid after his wife was dead, now let us kill the Dogs, and then they'l ≈øay we are mad indeed.</p>
            <p>And ≈øince the Tryall, it is known that Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:118431:5"/>
writ a Letter that Saturday morning to <hi>Roger Hooper,</hi> a Sea-man, to buy him Goods at <hi>London,</hi> and ≈øuch, and ≈øuch Books; and, to pay money at <hi>London</hi> for him; which Letter was rationall, in his u≈øuall form of writing. And ≈øince the tryall al≈øo, Mr. <hi>Hope≈øtill Tilden</hi> of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> affirmed in the hearing of many, that he being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times with Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> in Pri≈øon, heard him ≈øay, he kill'd his Wife, becau≈øe ≈øhe was a traitour to him, and ≈øayd, that if it were your ca≈øe <hi>Hope≈øtill,</hi> you would do the like to ≈øuch a Wife that went about to betray you, and undo you, and deliver you to the Bailiffs. And, I ≈øince hear, he affirmed the ≈øame to another, that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he went to Pri≈øon, ≈øaying, ≈øhe left the dores open on purpo≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for further Evidence at the tryall, many witne≈ø≈øes were called and ≈øworn, that te≈øtified, that this bloudy Oxe did u≈øe to pu≈øh in former time; and, that it was not a fit of frenzy at that time of the Murther rehear≈øed; but, that he was of an habitual bloody di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition and practi≈øe. One <hi>John Ru≈ø≈øell</hi> depo≈øed, that about twenty year before, he ≈øaw Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> endeavour to run one <hi>John Simons</hi> through with his naked Rapier, in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Pari≈øh, at a Tap-hou≈øe there, and had nayled him to the wall, had not he took hold on the hilt of the Rapier; and, that in another Tap-hou≈øe there, he ≈øaw Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> quarrell with one <hi>Giles,</hi> and drew his Sword at him; but, the Deponent did not follow Ma≈øter <hi>Sprackling</hi> into the next Room where <hi>Giles</hi> was; but, he ≈øaw <hi>Giles</hi> come bleeding out.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Robert Li≈øter</hi> depo≈øed, that Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> being wor≈øted in a quarrell in a Tap-hou≈øe in that Pari≈øh, lay there at one <hi>Homans</hi> all night, and ≈øent for his man <hi>Cor≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> his Champion, and next day morning, in cold blood, commanded his man <hi>Cor≈ølet</hi> to fall on the ≈øaid <hi>Robert Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,</hi> which he did pre≈øently, and ≈øtrook the ≈øaid <hi>Li≈øter</hi> on

            <p>
               <hi>Edward Taddy</hi> depo≈øed, that he being Con≈øtable, did a≈ø≈øi≈øt <hi>Humphery Pudner,</hi> the Maior of <hi>Dovers</hi> Deputy, at St. <hi>Johns</hi> pari≈øh, and <hi>Richard Langley,</hi> Deputy to the Maior of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> at St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Pari≈øh, when they three had an Order to di≈øarm Mr. <hi>Sprackling,</hi> and, having taken and ≈øecured the Arms in his hou≈øe, Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> a≈ø≈øaulted the ≈øaid <hi>Edward Taddy,</hi> when he met him ≈øome moneths after; And <hi>Humphrey Pudner</hi> depo≈øed, that he drew upon him al≈øo in the ≈øtreet; and, that he being Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, di≈øarm'd Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> in an affray, which he made in a Taphou≈øe in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Pari≈øh; And <hi>William Grant</hi> depo≈øed, that in that Pari≈øh he drew at him, and had cleav'd his head with his Cutla≈øh, if he had not put by the blow. Others were ready to depo≈øe many ≈øuch bloody a≈ø≈øaults done by Mr. <hi>Sprackling:</hi> But (above all) the death of <hi>Richard Langley</hi> of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Pari≈øh, was mentioned in Court. This <hi>Richard Langley</hi> was a very godly man, zealous for God and the State, had ≈øeized on Mr. <hi>Spracklings</hi> Arms, and Articled again≈øt him, ≈øo that Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> was ≈øecured at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at the fir≈øt of the Parliament: But Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> (being at liberty in the year 1648.) the day before the Kenti≈øh In≈øurrection bur≈øt out, armed hor≈øe and men, and went down from his own hou≈øe to the Sea-town there, called <hi>Ram≈øgate;</hi> that is Romans-gate, where the Romans fir≈øt Landed when they ≈øubdued this Nation: And <hi>Richard Langley</hi> living there, was ≈øought for; but, he hid him≈øelf in his hou≈øe for a time; but, hearing that Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> was there at the Tavern with Hor≈øe and Arms, and a rude crew with him, <hi>Langley</hi> crept out of his own hou≈øe, and

him, but not finding him departed, and going out, let fall his Pi≈øtoll in the entry of <hi>Langley</hi>'s hou≈øe, which Pi≈øtoll the Witne≈ø≈øe ≈øaw there, and took it up.</p>
            <p>After the Court had heard the Evidence again≈øt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter <hi>Sprackling,</hi> leave was given him to ≈øpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and to bring what witne≈øs he plea≈øed in his defence, he and they ≈øhould be fairly heard. He named two Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers for his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in form of Law, but none appeared. Two Phy≈øicians appeared in Court for him, and ≈øome women, to prove he was mad: but they ≈øpake only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things; only one Phy≈øician depo≈øed, that he had let him blood four times together in a fever, about a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that then he was in a di≈øtracted fitt; but none could ≈øwear he was di≈øtracted, neer, at, or after the Murther committed; only that he u≈øed to be outragious in pa≈ø≈øion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jury, giving up their Verdict, ≈øaid, they found Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> guilty of wilfull Murther.</p>
            <p>But they acquitted <hi>Martin,</hi> having no proof that he had Combined to kill the Gentlewoman, or a≈ø≈øi≈øted in killing her; but that, meerly out of fear of death to him≈øelf, he was willing to humour his Ma≈øter in binding <hi>Ewell,</hi> and in praying Mrs. <hi>Sprackling</hi> to ≈øtay: and <hi>Ewell</hi> upon oath ≈øayd, that he could not ≈øwear that he ≈øaw <hi>Martin</hi> lay hands on her, to keep her from going out, and <hi>Martin</hi> having al≈øo a good te≈øtimoniall of all his neighbours, of his peaceable and harmle≈øs life. The ≈øentence of death being pronounced by the Maior of <hi>Sandwich</hi> again≈øt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter <hi>Sprackling;</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Peak,</hi> the Steward, made a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall exhortation to Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> to repent; he ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the heinou≈øne≈øs of the fact, and aggravated it in regard of the murthered Gentlewomans worth, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable graces and vertues that ≈øhined forth in her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> an≈øwered; <hi>No man can judge between

man and wife, but God alone,</hi> and ≈øhewing ≈ømall token of Repentance, or of care for his ≈øoul, He only reque≈øted then, that his body might be delivered to four women, which he named in open Court. Being returned to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, he refu≈øed Conference with any, from his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his death. Divers godly Gentlemen and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters de≈øired to ≈øpeak to him, but he would admit none. There was a Lecture at <hi>Sandwich</hi> upon the day of his Execution. The Jayl joyned to the yard of the Church, where the Lecture was preached; yet he would not ≈øo much as ≈øend to be prayed for: But the Lecturer (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter <hi>John Durant</hi>) prayed earne≈øtly for him. In Pri≈øon he ≈øpake of Receiving the Sacrament by the mini≈øtring of Mr. <hi>Edward Fellows,</hi> but did not receive it.</p>
            <p>Upon the 27. day of <hi>April</hi> la≈øt, Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> being ready to go to Execution, de≈øired the Sheriff of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> to make a guard, that no man, Mini≈øter, or other, might come neer to ≈øpeak with him. He had notes in writing at his Execution to look on; He confe≈ø≈øed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall that he was a ≈øinner, and de≈øerved death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Two Mini≈øters pre≈øt neer him, and call'd upon him to con≈øider his condition, and to glorifie God by a free Confe≈ø≈øion, and exhortation to the people, there being (as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) at lea≈øt 2000. at his Execution; but he de≈øired the Mini≈øters not to trouble him: But one of the Mini≈øters pre≈ø≈øed <hi>Langley</hi>'s death upon him, and de≈øired him to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his con≈øcience in that, whether he were guilty or not; now was the time; as the tree falls, ≈øo it lyes; But Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi>'s an≈øwer was; <hi>Sir, I have made my confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to God, I pray trouble me not; man hath nothing to do with it, I pray ≈øpeak no more of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ≈øad pre≈øumption of his guiltine≈øs of <hi>Langley</hi>'s death; and that the report is true, which ≈øaith that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter <hi>Sprackling,</hi> when he ≈øent <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Emer≈øon</hi> after

It was the ≈øaying of many godly wi≈øe people, when they heard of Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi>'s murther of his Wife, that they were per≈øwaded that the cry of <hi>Richard Langley</hi>'s blood did move the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avenging God to leave Mr. <hi>Sprackling</hi> to fall to that Wife-murther, that ≈øuch a blood-thir≈øty man might not go to the Grave in peace.</p>
            <p>He was hanged in his Cloak, And afterwards put into a Coffin cloaths and all at the Gallows, and after ≈øtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and layd forth, and coffined at the ≈øign of the three Kings in <hi>Sandwich;</hi> and the next day towards night car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from thence ≈øix miles on mens ≈øhoulders over the Ferry to St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
